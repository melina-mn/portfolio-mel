      About Me

    <p class="about-prgh">
      <!-- When I started my first course as an artist at an early age for eight years, I learned to finish what I had started. Art is not something that will be finished one day. You learn more and more about it whenever you step one foot forward. So that did not stop me from following art, music, writing, etc. So I started attending violin classes. Then started writing texts to prepare myself to attend competitions about writing and I won an award. Art is my passion. So I started helping my friends and family with what I had learned through the internet. Editing videos and photos, even making videos and doing a few photoshops, and writing my journals on the internet. I put half of my life into learning this stuff. Not by force, but because of interest. That does not mean I have disconnected myself from the world. Next to art, I started studying physics and mathematics in high school. Before starting university, I moved to Sweden. Started learning Swedish and improving my English in Gymnasie nivÃ¥. I must confess that working as a teacher helped me become more fluent in Swedish.
      Learning IT-Front End was another door that opened to me to understand the tech world better. -->
      I am currently a dedicated student with a 
      strong passion for continuous learning. 
      Eager to broaden my horizons, I am actively 
      pursuing opportunities to expand my knowledge 
      and skills. I am in the process of applying to 
      a reputable university to pursue a degree in 
      Architecture, a field that aligns perfectly with 
      my creative mindset and analytical thinking. In the 
      interim, while awaiting the commencement of my studies, 
      I have proactively enrolled in various classes to further 
      enrich myself. One such endeavor includes learning the Italian 
      language. Additionally, I have also taken up hip-hop, a form of 
      expressive dance that allows me to channel my energy and creativity. 
      My insatiable thirst for knowledge drives me to constantly seek out 
      new growth opportunities.
