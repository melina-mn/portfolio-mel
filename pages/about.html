      About Me
    </h1>
    <p class="about-prgh">
      When I started my first course as an artist at an early age for eight years, I learned to finish what I had started. Art is not something that will be finished one day. You learn more and more about it whenever you step one foot forward. So that did not stop me from following art, music, writing, etc. So I started attending violin classes. Then started writing texts to prepare myself to attend competitions about writing and I won an award. Art is my passion. So I started helping my friends and family with what I had learned through the internet. Editing videos and photos, even making videos and doing a few photoshops, and writing my journals on the internet. I put half of my life into learning this stuff. Not by force, but because of interest. That does not mean I have disconnected myself from the world. Next to art, I started studying physics and mathematics in high school. Before starting university, I moved to Sweden. Started learning Swedish and improving my English in Gymnasie niv√•. I must confess that working as a teacher helped me become more fluent in Swedish.
      Learning IT-Front End was another door that opened to me to understand the tech world better.
